== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and Markdown parsed.

== Installation ==

Install and activate like any other plugin!

* You can upload the plugin zip file via the *Plugins â€£ Add New* screen
* You can unzip the plugin and then upload to your plugin directory (typically _wp-content/plugins_) via FTP
* Once it has been installed or uploaded, simply visit the main plugin list and activate it

== Setup and Customization ==
Each filter group has a `tec_labs_custom_category_{$alias}_filter_wanted_categories` filter, where {$alias} is replaced with the
filer-specific alias (the number 1-5)

This extension is set up to run one custom category filter group. The `tec_labs_custom_category_filter_groups_number` filter
lets you add additional filter groups (up to 5!). It defaults to one (1) but you can filter this value up to five with
no modifications to this extension. If you need more (!) you will have to copy one of the classes in src/Tec/Filters
and rework it for the new number.
